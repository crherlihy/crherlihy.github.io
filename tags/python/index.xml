      <description>The objective of this project is to develop an open-source NLP platform capable of ingesting structured and unstructured patient-level data and notes, and extracting clinically relevant features for the purpose of determining eligibility for clinical trials, constructing reproducible, computational phenotypes, and building patient-level predictive models.
I am currently focused on integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including non-negative matrix factorization for the purpose of topic modeling, and explore the extent to which real-valued, vector based representations of unstructured texts (e.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Platform to Facilitate Patient-Directed Record Sharing</title>

      <description>The objective of this GTRI HIVE $25K seed grant project was to develop a decentralized system to facilitate patient-directed provider-to-provider electronic medical record sharing. This required me to solve two related problems: (1) patient matching across EHRs, given the use of inconsistent identifiers; and (2) data transfer in the (potential) absence of provider-to-provider joint database access.
The prototype I developed involves representing patients, healthcare providers, and patient-designated stakeholders as nodes on a blockchain network, conducting pairwise cryptographic handshakes, and then allowing them to interact with a smart contract that resembles an escrow account, to facilitate patient-directed provider-to-provider record sharing in the absence of universal patient IDs.</description>

      <title>Chest X-ray Disease Diagnosis with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>I completed this project in conjunction with my graduate coursework as a student in CSE 6250: Big Data Analytics for Healthcare. I worked with my classmates, Charity Hilton and Kausar Mukadam, to develop a PyTorch-based pipeline to use CNNs to detect and localize the 14 thoracic pathologies present in the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
Our final paper outlines our approach and presents our empirical results.</description>
