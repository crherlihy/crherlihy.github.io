      <description>The objective of this project is to develop an open-source NLP platform capable of ingesting structured and unstructured patient-level data and notes, and extracting clinically relevant features for the purpose of determining eligibility for clinical trials, constructing reproducible, computational phenotypes, and building patient-level predictive models.
I am currently focused on integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including non-negative matrix factorization for the purpose of topic modeling, and explore the extent to which real-valued, vector based representations of unstructured texts (e.</description>

      <description>I completed this project in conjunction with my graduate coursework as a student in CSE 6250: Big Data Analytics for Healthcare. I worked with my classmates, Charity Hilton and Kausar Mukadam, to develop a PyTorch-based pipeline to use CNNs to detect and localize the 14 thoracic pathologies present in the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
Our final paper outlines our approach and presents our empirical results.</description>
