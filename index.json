[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The objective of this project is to develop an open-source NLP platform capable of ingesting structured and unstructured patient-level data and notes, and extracting clinically relevant features for the purpose of determining eligibility for clinical trials, constructing reproducible, computational phenotypes, and building patient-level predictive models.\nI am currently focused on integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including non-negative matrix factorization for the purpose of topic modeling, and explore the extent to which real-valued, vector based representations of unstructured texts (e.g., patient notes, clinical trial inclusion criteria; user-generated queries, etc.) can be used for dimesionality reduction and/or standardized evaluation of semantically similar documents.\nDuring the Fall 2018 semester, as a student in CS 8803: Data Analytics Using Deep Learning, I had the opportunity to work with my colleague, classmate (and lead ClarityNLP dev!) Charity Hilton on optimizing portions of this platform. Our final paper outlines our approach and presents our empirical results. We plan to integrate a subset of our improvements soon.\nThis project is under active development, and we host bi-weekly Cooking with ClarityNLP tutorial sessions, which you can join in real-time via webex; Jupyter notebooks and recordings from past sessions are also posted. We welcome questions and suggestions for future sessions via Twitter (use the hashtag #cookingWithClarityNLP), GitHub, or Slack.\n","date":1548046800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548046800,"objectID":"6a622a3580f80a0ab981e5c539018164","permalink":"https://crherlihy.github.io/project/claritynlp/","publishdate":"2019-01-21T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/claritynlp/","section":"project","summary":"An open-source NLP framework for clinical phenotyping.","tags":["machine learning","health informatics","computational phenotyping","feature engineering","nlp","python","graduate coursework"],"title":"ClarityNLP","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of this DARPA project is to develop an open-source information extraction pipeline that can be used to ingest epidemiology papers and associated source code repositories, extract entities that represent scientific model concepts (e.g., model parameters, functions, causal relationships, etc.), and use these entities to construct a semantic knowledge graph, that can be traversed to create meta-models (e.g., novel combinations/parameterizations of modeling concepts), and/or probablistically reason about how to go from a set of known input(s) to a set of unknown but abstractly identifiable, unitful output(s).\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"98d00795bbdf0038b2a2d758c717e65c","permalink":"https://crherlihy.github.io/project/aske/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/aske/","section":"project","summary":"Extraction and graph-based representation of scientific model components for the purpose of metamodel generation.","tags":["knowledge graph","metamodeling","scientific knowledge","multimodal information","julia"],"title":"Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction (ASKE)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The objective of this GTRI HIVE $25K seed grant project was to develop a decentralized system to facilitate patient-directed provider-to-provider electronic medical record sharing.
